It has a heavier appearance than actual Sindarin, which makes it look not that Elvish and ethereal )= Work to do yet.

Still:
	allow nt, rn, nc, st, lf, nn and ss at word ending
	not allow two vowel-only syllables in a row
	not allow long nuclei in the last syllable of a word
	shift VV into V́
	shift final e into ë
	shift nB into mB
	shift f into ph when word final and into v when after n
	possibility to geminate next c, l, m, n, p, r or t
I just don't get how ts, ps and ks work in Sindarin

Clusters allegedly belonging to the language but not found in corpora (could be due to having found the wrong ones, of course =D ): qu,, khw, ghw, nw (ancient "-nw", with vocalic "w", and in positions where the "n" belongs to the previous syllable), ly, my, ny (Vinyar exists, but not inside the text istelf), ry (only in ancient "firya"), ps, ts, ks.
